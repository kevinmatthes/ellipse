# `./lib/`

## Description

This directory contains the C++ source code for the provided library. It
contains the main header as well as the implementation of all methods.

For better maintainability, each method is stored in a separate source file.  In
case there should be multiple implementations for one method by overloading the
function, all overloads of the same function can be found in the same file.

The library is built using GNU Octave whose installation therefore needs to be
ensured.
